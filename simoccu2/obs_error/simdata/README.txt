Simulation files for simulation study 2. sim_colony_<sim.nr>_e<err.nr>.csv are simulated individual (which in our case are colonies) 
count data on the site-level. sim_shell_<sim.r>_e<err.nr>.csv are simulated subsample (in our case shells) data on the site-level. 
There error number refers to the array of observational error probabilities, defined in the script "simoccu_save.R".
